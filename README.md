Toj Tu Yeetel
=================

Toj Tu Yeetel (Healthy crop in Mayan) is a simple crop tracking system for farmers. 
- They can track their crops, when they were planted and when it's harvesting day.
- They can report their crop's pests and plagues.
- View a map that shows the crop's GPS position and other informational data.

A use case example: The app is used to report a crop plague in greenhouses or nearby areas, so that the farmers can take action before the crops fall victim to the plague, thus preventing the economic loss that results from disposing contaminated products.
